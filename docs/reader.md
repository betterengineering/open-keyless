# Open Keyless Reader
The Open Keyless Reader module is designed to go on the outside of a entryway. Because this is outside of the area of
which it is controlling access, only the RFID reader and small piezo speaker is contained in this module. All other
components, including the connection to the electric door strike is contained in the
(Open Keyless Controller)[controller.md]. If you find a security flaw or an optimization for the current design, feel
free to open a Github issue or pull request.
